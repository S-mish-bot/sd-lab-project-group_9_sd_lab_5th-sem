# Student Attendance by Barcode Scanner

The proposed project is a system that keeps a track of students attendance using barcode scanner. This concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system of calling out Serial/Roll Numbers in class.
The proposed system uses barcode method for authenticating students with a unique barcode that represents their unique id. Every student will have their barcode on their Identity Cards.

## Advantages

-Student will be more regular as the system notes down the time along with the attendance.

-It saves time, cost, efforts and organization resources.

-The system helps the admin to easily find out latecomers.

## Disadvantages

-The only disadvantage is that it requires a barcode reader to access the system.
